The UI designer at your company, Site.ly, has just handed you four layouts of the new site to be built for your client.

The design team requests that you use bootstrap to implement them. Feel free to put in placeholder images and text for now. [Placekittens](http://www.placekittens.com) and [Hipster Ipsum](http://hipsum.co/) are great resources.
